# ABAP MCP Server Tests

[Discord](https://discord.gg/jf2FhnFvSn) - for all ABAP-AI repos.

## Overview

This repository contains Test abap and typescript code for the [abap-ai/mcp](https://github.com/abap-ai/mcp) repository. It is mostly intended for development purposes and currently aligned with my local environment. If we get more contributors in future I will adapt it to be more generic. The TypeScript test are in the test folder, src is for ABAP source code.
Currently can also be used to have a look at a bit more advanced features of the SDK not covered by the demo servers.

## GenAI Notice

Part of the coding was generated using AI, mostly with Sonnet 3.7 and GitHub Copilot. Detailed documentation is largely AI generated - only high-level reviewed.
